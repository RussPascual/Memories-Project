The 'Memories Project' is a MERN Application that allows users to create, edit, like, and delete new posts that contain a memory.
These posts include titles, descriptions, images, likes, and tags which can all be modified.

Future Updates
--------------

Authentication and Logins will be implemented soon so that users cannot modify other users' posts.
